# Electric Vehicle Population Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes electric vehicle population data from Washington state. The dataset contains information about electric vehicles such as model year, make, electric vehicle type, electric range, and more. Using Python's pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib libraries, we explore trends and characteristics of electric vehicles in the region.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Loading:** We load the dataset "Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv" using pandas.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Null values are removed, and data beyond the year 2020 is filtered out.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Distribution of electric vehicles across cities and manufacturers is analyzed.
   - Types of electric vehicles and their electric range are explored.
   - Correlation between model year, electric range, and base MSRP is investigated.
4. **Visualization:** Various visualizations such as bar plots, pie charts, and heatmaps are created to illustrate insights from the data.

## Results
- Tesla emerges as the most popular electric vehicle manufacturer, followed by Chevrolet and Nissan.
- Seattle leads in the number of registered Tesla cars.
- Over the years, there's a general increase in the electric range of vehicles, with Tesla leading in providing higher-range vehicles.
- Newer models tend to have lower base MSRP, indicating a trend of decreasing prices.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into the electric vehicle landscape in Washington state. The dominance of Tesla and the increasing availability of high-range electric vehicles are notable trends. These findings can inform decision-making for policymakers, manufacturers, and consumers interested in electric vehicles.
